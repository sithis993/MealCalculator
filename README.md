## Overview
Meal Calculator aims to provids a simple way to calculate the calorie and macronutrient contents of an entire meal. While nutritional labels make it easy to track ready-meals, snacks and packaged foods, determining a meal's nutrition becomes difficult when there are more than three or four ingredients. 

This app will give you the calories, fat, carbohydrates and protein of your week's meal prep, or individual meal, per 100g. You can then add this meal to your Meal Tracking app of choice, weigh out your portion/serving each day and track it.

To make this process even easier, you can save and load both individual ingredients and Meals to your computer; allowing you to quickly use key ingredient across multiple meals, or reload a entire meal in the future.
