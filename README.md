## Overview
Meal Calculator aims to provide a simple way to calculate the calorie and macronutrient contents of an entire meal. While nutritional labels make it easy to track ready-meals, snacks and packaged foods, determining a meal's nutrition becomes difficult when there are more than three or four ingredients. 

This app will give you the calories, fat, carbohydrates and protein of your week's meal prep, or individual meal, per 100g. You can then add this meal to your Meal Tracking app of choice, weigh out your portion/serving each day and track it.

To make this process even easier, you can save and load both individual ingredients and Meals to your computer; allowing you to quickly use key ingredients across multiple meals, or reload a entire meal in the future.

## Basic Usage
- Open the application
- Create meal ingredients by filling in ingredient information and clicking **Add to Meal**
- Click **Calculate** to calculate and display the meal's nutrition

## Purpose
This application is not at all security related and isn't one of my *usual projects*. However, I needed a quick and easy method for calculating the nutrition of the individual meals I was eating, as well as the nutrition of my weekly meal-prep and batch cooked meals. While there are a lot of meal tracking apps and calculators available, they're often unnecessarily complex, filled with ads and require you to *sign-in*. 

I decided to create an application that focuses on simplicity; allowing you track meals as quickly and easily as possible. Hopefully others may find this applcation to be as useful as I have.
